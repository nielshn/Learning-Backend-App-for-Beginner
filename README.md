# Bookshelf API Backend App

This project aims to develop a robust RESTful API for managing a digital bookshelf. Below are the key features and implementation details of the project:

**Project Objective**: The objective of the final project was to design and implement a RESTful API for a digital note-taking application, showcasing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for managing notes.

### Key Features:

- **Create Note**: Users can create new notes by providing relevant information such as title, content, and category.
- **Read Note**: Users can retrieve existing notes from the database by specifying parameters such as note ID or category.
- **Update Note**: Users can update the content or category of existing notes based on their preferences.
- **Delete Note**: Users can delete notes from the database, removing them permanently from the system.

### Implementation Details:

- **Routing**: Implemented robust routing mechanisms to handle different CRUD operations for notes.
- **Data Storage**: Utilized databases such as MongoDB or MySQL to store and manage note data persistently.
- **Authentication**: Implemented authentication mechanisms to restrict access to authorized users only.
- **Validation**: Implemented input validation to ensure the integrity and security of user-provided data.
- **Documentation**: Provided comprehensive documentation for the API endpoints, including usage instructions and response formats.

### Technologies Used:

- Node.js: Used as the runtime environment for executing server-side JavaScript code.
- Hapi Framework: Leveraged the Hapi framework to streamline the development of RESTful APIs.
- Database (e.g., MongoDB or MySQL): Used to store and manage note data persistently.
- Postman: Used for testing API endpoints and verifying functionality during development.
